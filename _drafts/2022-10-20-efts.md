## Low energy manifestation

* Field theory may not be a fundamental description of nature. To presume that our theory holds at all possible energy scales is clear hubris. Instead, field theories may be a **low energy manifestation** of a deeper structure.
* The general idea is that we can use field theory to say something about physics at low energies that is agnostic to the high-energy details of the true ultimate theory. 
* From this perspective, quantum field theory now provides an effective description of physics up to an effective energy scale $\Lambda$. This parameterizes our 'threshold of ignorance' - beyond which physics not included in the theory comes into play.
* Non-renormalizable theories are now acceptable - the physical observables calculated from these theories may be dependent on $\Lambda$ - but these indicate that the physics beyond the scale $\Lambda$ is essential for understanding the low-energy physics we are studying. 
* In fact, non-renormalizable theories have the ability to foretell their own demise - e.g. Fermi's theory of the weak interaction and Einstein's theory involve respective coupling constants $g$ with $\left[g\right] = -2$ - if we calculate scattering amplitudes at energy scale $\Lambda$, they take the schematic form, from dimensional analysis:

    $$\begin{equation}
        \mathcal{M} \sim g + g^2\Lambda^2 + \cdots
    \end{equation}$$

    This yields predicted values of infinity for a physical quantity - the theory is regarded as 'sick', but really announcing that new physics must take over when the second term in the perturbation series becomes comparable to the first, at $\Lambda \sim 1/\sqrt{g}$. Fermi's theory cried ou and the new physics turned out to be the electroweak theory. Einstein's theory is now crying out.

# About
This is a public set of notes and half-baked thoughts on material I find interesting, mainly on math/machine learning. By clearly explaining the things I know now here, future me wastes less time looking stuff up.

<!-- To get more biographical, I am a first-year PhD candidate in the computer science department at the University of Cambridge, supervised by Dr. Challenger Mishra. In a former life I was an experimental physicist working on the Belle II experiment. I currently work on geometric ML methods applied to theoretical physics. -->

## Personal Interests

<!-- ## Projectsy

### Neural Image Compression

* [Project Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Justin-Tan/high-fidelity-generative-compression/blob/master/assets/HiFIC_torch_colab_demo.ipynb)

* [Source Code](https://github.com/Justin-Tan/high-fidelity-generative-compression)

This project defines a learnable compression scheme for images of arbitrary size and resolution, and provides a general framework for neural image compression in PyTorch. This will convert images to bitstreams requiring around two orders of magnitude less memory while maintaining similar perceptual quality. The idea is to 'amortize' the memory required to store an image by training a neural model for learnable compression/decompression. This is similar to the transforms used in standard image codecs such as JPEG, except now the transforms are nonlinear and learnable.

The model is capable of yielding perceptually similar reconstructions to the input that tend to be more visually pleasing than traditional image codecs which operate at comparable or higher bitrates.

This project was based on two interesting papers by Mentzer et. al. ([[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09965), [[2]]((https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12817))). -->

## Miscellanea

## Teaching

I've been a teaching assistant for several graduate/undergraduate courses in the computer science department at the University of Melbourne.

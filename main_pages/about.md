# About
This is a site that stores extended notes on material I find interesting, mainly on math and machine learning. By clearly explaining the things I know now here, future me wastes less time looking stuff up. Hopefully these posts will be of use or interest to you. 
## Personal Interests:
Bruce Springsteen, hanging out with my neighbour's cat, soccer. Sometimes machine learning.

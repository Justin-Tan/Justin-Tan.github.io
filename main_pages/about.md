# About
This is a public set of notes and half-baked thoughts on material I find interesting. By clearly(?) explaining the things I know now here, future me wastes marginally less time looking stuff up.

In a former life I was an experimental flavour physicist working on the Belle II experiment, but now do more abstract physics.

<!-- To get more biographical, I am a first-year PhD candidate in the computer science department at the University of Cambridge, supervised by Dr. Challenger Mishra. In a former life I was an experimental physicist working on the Belle II experiment. I currently work on geometric ML methods applied to theoretical physics. -->

## Personal Interests

Bruce Springsteen, hanging out with my neighbour's cat, football.

## Miscellanea

### Transcriptions

Partial piano transcriptions of notable songs recorded live.

* Thunder Road (opening, draft) - West Hollywood, 1975. The first track on Springsteen's famed Live 1975-85 album.
* [Incident on 57th Street (opening, draft)](/assets/scores/incident.pdf) - Main Point, 1975.
* Piano Man (bridge, draft) - Long Island, 1982.


## Teaching

I run supervisions in Bayesian inference / Machine learning / Information theory for Part II of the CS tripos at Cambridge. Supervisions are an archaic but effective 
teaching system at Oxbridge, where students interact in small groups (2-3) with an appointed tutor. I find them more fun than usual TA duties, but cannot speak for my supervisees.

In the distant past I was a teaching assistant for several graduate/undergraduate courses in the CS/mathematics department at the University of Melbourne.

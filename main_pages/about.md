# About
This is a public subset of technical notes and half-baked thoughts on material I find interesting, mainly on math and machine learning. The rest get sent to `/dev/null`. By clearly explaining the things I know now here, future me wastes less time looking stuff up. Hopefully my strangely arranged personal encyclopedia will be of use or interest to you.

## Personal Interests

Bruce Springsteen, hanging out with my neighbour's cat, soccer. Sometimes machine learning.

<!-- ## Projects

### Neural Image Compression

* [Project Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Justin-Tan/high-fidelity-generative-compression/blob/master/assets/HiFIC_torch_colab_demo.ipynb)

* [Source Code](https://github.com/Justin-Tan/high-fidelity-generative-compression)

This project defines a learnable compression scheme for images of arbitrary size and resolution, and provides a general framework for neural image compression in PyTorch. This will convert images to bitstreams requiring around two orders of magnitude less memory while maintaining similar perceptual quality. The idea is to 'amortize' the memory required to store an image by training a neural model for learnable compression/decompression. This is similar to the transforms used in standard image codecs such as JPEG, except now the transforms are nonlinear and learnable.

The model is capable of yielding perceptually similar reconstructions to the input that tend to be more visually pleasing than traditional image codecs which operate at comparable or higher bitrates.

This project was based on two interesting papers by Mentzer et. al. ([[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09965), [[2]]((https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12817))). -->

## Teaching

I've been a teaching assistant for several graduate/undergraduate courses in the Computer Science department at the University of Melbourne.
